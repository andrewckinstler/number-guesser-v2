# number-guesser-v2

## Hello
This is my Number Guesser project. 

It is a game where two people try to get a random number. It does that. 
It is supposed to generate cards that tell you who the winner is. It does not do that. 
You can tell it what range you would like to be able to guess in and you can make all of the information that you thought long and hard about disappear. Its favorite word is BOOM and its favorite color is #DD1972. 

Thank you for your time. 

P.S. It looks like this.
